3. What is Data Binding? Which type of data binding does Angular deploy?
   Data binding is a mechanism where data synchroniztion happens between model and view.

There are two types of data binding in angular
 * One Way Binding ---   data flows in a single direction, either from the component to the view (interpolation or property binding) or from the view to the component (event binding).
 * Two Way Binding ---   Two-way binding is a combination of both one-way binding for property binding and event binding. It simplifies the synchronization between the component and 
                         the view by using the ngModel directive, allowing changes in the view to update the component and vice versa.

4. what are the advantages of Databinding in Angular?

* Reduced Boilerplate Code  : Data binding eliminates the need for manual DOM manipulation, reducing the amount of code developers need to write.

* Improved Readability and Maintainability: Binding expressions in the template make it clear how data is flowing between the component and the view, enhancing code readability. 
                                            This, in turn, makes the codebase more maintainable.

* Responsive User Interfaces: With automatic updates triggered by data changes, Angular applications can provide a seamless and responsive user experience.

* Ease of Development: Data binding simplifies the development process by abstracting away many complexities associated with managing the DOM, allowing developers to focus on application logic.
